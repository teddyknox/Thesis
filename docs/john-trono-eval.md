- Made his points clearly, atlhough dryly

Describe the organization of the presentation. Was there a clear progression of information telling a story or making an argument? Could you tell where you were in the presentation without looking at the clock?
- Teach crypto by explaining the design of a basic system.

How did the presenter make use of visual aids? Was there a lot of text that you had to read/got read at you? Did the presentation include images and diagrams that augmented/supported what the presenter was saying, or was there an abundance of clip art or meaningless diagrams?
