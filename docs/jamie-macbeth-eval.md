# Jamie Macbeth Candidate Talk

What was one thing you learned that you didnâ€™t know before?
 
What were the main points of the talk? How clearly were they made?
- themes
  - crowdsourcing
- defining a problem: bullying prevention using machine learning
- approaches to solving this problem

Describe the organization of the presentation. Was there a clear progression of information telling a story or making an argument? Could you tell where you were in the presentation without looking at the clock?
- Giving us a background of the things he's interested in
- Giving us a background on the problem he's interested in solving.

How did the presenter make use of visual aids? Was there a lot of text that you had to read/got read at you? Did the presentation include images and diagrams that augmented/supported what the presenter was saying, or was there an abundance of clip art or meaningless diagrams? How would the removal of the visual aids affected the presentation?
- not a ton of text, good use of visual aids
- uses mostly images on his slides
- infographic use was good

Describe the style of the presenter. Did he or she engage your interest? make eye contact? interact with the audience? speak clearly and fluidly?
- spoke fluidly
- good connection
- engaged my interests early

List 2-3 strengths of the presentation.
- great graphs
- gives the right level of abstraction for complex ML concepts

List 2-3 weaknesses of the presentation.
- I think he got bogged down in the middle of his presentation in defining the sophistication of the bullying problem.
- spent a lot of time explaining conceptual high level details of early solutions to this problem.
- Spent a lot of time discussing experimental results involving people rather than algorithmic advances.

Any general feedback? Would you take a class from this presenter? Was the topic relevant/interesting to you or to CS students in general?
- Didn't know much about machine learning, only about the problems people have faced.
