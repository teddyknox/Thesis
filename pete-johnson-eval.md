0. What were the main points of the talk? How clearly were they made?
  - intro to theory of computation with some research at the end
  - builds up to Rice's theorem, and relates it to computer security
0. Describe the organization of the presentation. Was there a clear progression of information telling a story or making an argument? Could you tell where you were in the presentation without looking at the clock?
  - introduction
  - series of examples, defining terms, explaining concepts
  - you could tell where you were in the presentation, he is clearly building towards something
0. How did the presenter make use of visual aids? Was there a lot of text that you had to read/got read at you? Did the presentation include images and diagrams that augmented/supported what the presenter was saying, or was there an abundance of clip art or meaningless diagrams? How would the removal of the visual aids affected the presentation?
  - blackboard presentation
  - drew illustrations for his first few points, but not for recursively enumerable and turing machine.
  - lost my attention when he stopped using visual devices
0. Describe the style of the presenter. Did he or she engage your interest? make eye contact? interact with the audience? speak clearly and fluidly?
  - did a casual and down to earth intro
  - articulate metaphors and examples
0. List 2-3 strengths of the presentation.
  - nice signposting
  - Interesting, he connects with the audience
  - very intuitive explanations
0. List 2-3 weaknesses of the presentation.
- intrinsic to his presentation style, more lecture oriented than research talk oriented
  - some small mistakes
    - board technique could be improved
    - mistakenly called a student wrong
    - could have used more precise language
- seemed kind of self-aware, could have moved a bit quicker and used less emphasis in some places
0. Any general feedback? Would you take a class from this presenter? Was the topic relevant/interesting to you or to CS students in general?
- I would take a class from this professor, but only if the curriculum was well defined
- Relatively interesting topic, a fast moving lecture supposing student intelligence
- I like his teaching style.. it's human in the sense that it covered the fun parts of the topic and glossed over the edge cases and crazy notation.
