# Visualizing Neural Networks
_Can we come up with a novel and meaningful visualization of large scale neural nets?_

## Meetings with Prof. Andrews

_2/9/15_  __First meeting__

Discuss ideas and postpone meaningful research topic decisions until after further preliminary research.

_2/10/15_ Cancelled for LinkedIn phone call
